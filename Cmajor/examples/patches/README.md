# Cmajor Example Patches

This folder contains various example patches which you can try in various ways:

- If you have the [VScode Cmajor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CmajorSoftware.cmajor-tools), just open one of the `.cmajorpatch` files in VScode and use the `Cmajor: Run Patch` command.
- If you've installed the [command-line tool](https://github.com/cmajor-lang/cmajor/releases), just run `cmaj play name_of_patch.cmajorpatch`.
- Load the [Cmajor VST/AU plugin](https://github.com/cmajor-lang/cmajor/releases) in a DAW of your choice and drag-and-drop one of the `.cmajorpatch` files onto its GUI.
